abstract = "Context
A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts, videos and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results.
Objective
There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE.
Method
To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example.
Results
The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.
Conclusion
Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences."

Igualmente, foram estabelecidos alguns critérios de busca e recuperação da informação, como o uso e a combinação das palavras-chave literatura branca e literatura cinzenta; utilização de operadores booleanos; uso de aspas nas expressões de busca; e supressão de palavras vazias. Foram recuperadas publicações em português, castelhano, inglês e italiano. Os resultados obtidos revelam uma multiplicidade de conceitos, sinônimos, equivalentes idiomáticos, características, além de vários tipos e exemplos de documentos que pertencem às categorias literatura branca e literatura cinzenta. Em síntese, a Internet, o desenvolvimento das Tecnologias da Informação e Comunicação e o consequente aperfeiçoamento dos mecanismos de armazenamento, busca e recuperação da informação darão novas formas de acesso às literaturas branca e cinzenta.},

abstract = "Recently, several works have been focused on designing and optimising the use of Agricultural Cyber-Physical System (ACPS). Therefore, a variety of ACPSs has been developed for the management of different services in precision agriculture. In this context, we present a new approach to the cyberisation of solar photovoltaic water systems (SPVWS) for remote irrigation management. A typical ACPS architecture design is adopted and extended to support the solar irrigation facility. The distributed architecture is based on the client–server paradigm using Vert.x as a reactive platform, which guarantees a bi-directional communication between the operational level deployed in the greenhouse and the supervisory level hosted in the cloud. The operational level deploys embedded devices which host a set of event-driven components responsible for transmitting external resources data, handling notifications, and executing orders provided at the supervisory level. The cloud incorporates several reactive micro-services performing advanced analyses and data mining in order to support remote control tasks. Within this architecture, users with different roles can remotely monitor and manage the activities of the SPVWS. A successful case study of an experimental greenhouse demonstrated the feasibility of the approach in term of low-cost and good performance in task management."
